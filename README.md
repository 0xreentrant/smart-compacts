# Smart Compacts - Engagements On-Chain

Smart contracts for a completely on-chain hiring agency. 

## challenges (short content)
- [IPFS and retrieving data](docs/IPFS challenges)
- [exhuastive-deps set in create-react-app](docs/exhuastive-deps set in create-react-app)

## Roadmap
- [X] state transitions are sane ([xstate](docs/xstate.md))
- [X] interfaces between contract and frontend are enforced ([typescript and typechain](docs/typescript and typechain.md))
- [X] developer experience with tooling ([hardhat tasks](docs/hardhat tasks.md))
- [ ] user experience is reasonable ([design and layout](docs/design and layout))
- [ ] data over the wire is validated ([validation and yup](docs/validation and yup))
- [ ] contract is sane ([waffle tests](docs/waffle tests))
- [ ] frontend is sane ([frontend tests](docs/frontend tests))
- [ ] gas costs reasonable ([solidity optimizations](docs/solidity optimizations))

- [ ] Readable and ready for other developers ([code style and docstrings](docs/code style and docstrings))

## What I would do further if this were to grow:

- Convert all files to TSX (including configs)
