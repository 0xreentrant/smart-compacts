# Smart Compacts - Engagements On-Chain

Smart contracts for a completely on-chain hiring agency. 

## challenges (short content)
- [IPFS and retrieving data](docs/IPFS-challenges.md)
- [exhuastive-deps set in create-react-app](docs/exhuastive-deps-set-in-create-react-app.md)

## Roadmap
- [X] state transitions are sane ([xstate](docs/xstate.md))
- [X] interfaces between contract and frontend are enforced ([typescript and typechain](docs/typescript-and-typechain.md))
- [X] developer experience with tooling ([hardhat tasks](docs/hardhat-tasks.md))
- [ ] user experience is reasonable ([design and layout](docs/design-and-layout.md))
- [ ] data over the wire is validated ([validation and yup](docs/validation-and-yup.md))
- [ ] contract is sane ([waffle tests](docs/waffle-tests.md))
- [ ] frontend is sane ([frontend tests](docs/frontend-tests.md))
- [ ] gas costs reasonable ([solidity optimizations](docs/solidity-optimizations.md))
- [ ] Readable and ready for other developers ([code style and docstrings](docs/code-style-and-docstrings.md))

## What I would do further if this were to grow:

- Convert all files to TSX (including configs)
