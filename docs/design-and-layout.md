Goal of the layout is to make sure the user can understand what's possible in the current context. A simple Edit/Preview flow was chosen, where only the relevant features would be active during the respective context (Edit context/Preview context). Disabling and buttons when the context shifts is used to inform the user what's possible.  It was also chosen avoid the confusion of buttons disappearing and appearing, which could be disorienting to new users.
